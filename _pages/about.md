I am **Kevin Ndayishimiye**, a sophomore undergraduate at **Howard University** pursuing a major in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Physics. I am also honored to be a **Presidential Scholar** at the university.

My research interests primarily lie in the intersection of **Applied Mathematics and Statistics**. Currently, I am focused on developing **Spatially Smoothed Ecological Inference Models**, contributing to more robust and accurate statistical analysis of aggregated data.

Beyond my core coursework, I serve as a Student Researcher at the [HBCU IBM Quantum Center at Howard University](https://www.hbcuquantumcenter.org/), where I explore emerging applications in quantum computing. I am deeply committed to education and community outreach, which I express through my role as a middle school tutor at the [Howard University Middle School for Mathematics and Science (MS)²](https://hu-ms2.org/).
