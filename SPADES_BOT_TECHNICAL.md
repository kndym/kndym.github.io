# Spades AI: A Deep Dive into the Mathematics

This document explains the mathematical and statistical foundations behind the Spades AI bot, designed for readers interested in game theory, machine learning, and decision-making algorithms.

---

## Overview

The Spades bot combines two powerful AI techniques:

1. **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** - A probabilistic search algorithm for decision-making
2. **Neural Networks** - Deep learning models that guide the search and evaluate positions

This hybrid approach, popularized by DeepMind's AlphaGo and AlphaZero, allows the bot to play strategically without hand-coded rules.

## 1. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

### The Core Idea

MCTS addresses the fundamental challenge in game AI: the game tree is too large to search exhaustively. With 52 cards, 4 players, and complex bidding/playing phases, Spades has approximately 10^20 possible game states.

Instead of exploring everything, MCTS uses **random sampling** to focus computational effort on the most promising moves.

### The Four Phases

Each MCTS iteration consists of four phases:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. SELECTION    →  2. EXPANSION  →  3. SIMULATION  →  4. BACKPROP  │
│                                                                 │
│  Navigate tree      Add new         Random          Update       │
│  using UCB1         child node      rollout         statistics   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Phase 1: Selection

Starting from the root (current game state), we traverse the tree by selecting child nodes that maximize the **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB1)** formula:

$$
\text{UCB1}(s, a) = \underbrace{\frac{Q(s, a)}{N(s, a)}}_{\text{exploitation}} + \underbrace{c \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\ln N(s)}{N(s, a)}}}_{\text{exploration}}
$$

Where:
- $Q(s, a)$ = Total value accumulated for action $a$ in state $s$
- $N(s, a)$ = Number of times action $a$ was selected in state $s$
- $N(s)$ = Total visits to state $s$
- $c$ = Exploration constant (we use $c = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.41$)

**Intuition**: The first term favors moves that have worked well (exploitation). The second term favors moves that haven't been tried much (exploration). The balance ensures we don't miss good moves.

#### Phase 2: Expansion

When we reach a node that hasn't been fully explored, we add a new child node representing an untried action.

#### Phase 3: Simulation (Rollout)

From the new node, we simulate the rest of the game using a fast heuristic policy:

- **Bidding**: Count high spades (Q, K, A) and off-suit aces
- **Playing**: Play the lowest valid card (conservative strategy)

This gives us a game outcome without expensive computation.

#### Phase 4: Backpropagation

The simulation result propagates back up the tree:

$$
Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + v
$$
$$
N(s, a) \leftarrow N(s, a) + 1
$$

Where $v$ is the value from the simulation (win probability).

### Convergence Properties

A key theorem of MCTS: as iterations $\to \infty$, the algorithm converges to the **minimax optimal strategy**. In practice, even 30-150 iterations per move produce strong play.

---

## 2. Neural Network Guidance (PUCT)

Pure MCTS treats all unexplored moves equally. We enhance it with neural networks using **Predictor Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT)**:

$$
\text{PUCT}(s, a) = \frac{Q(s, a)}{N(s, a)} + c \cdot P(a|s) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{N(s)}}{1 + N(s, a)}
$$

Where $P(a|s)$ is the **prior probability** from a neural network, representing how likely a strong player would choose action $a$.

This focuses search on moves the neural network considers promising, dramatically improving efficiency.

## 3. The Three Neural Networks

### NN1: Bidding Policy Network

**Purpose**: Predict the optimal bid (0-13) given the current game state.

**Architecture**:
```
Input Layer:  8 features
Hidden:       64 → 64 → 64 (ReLU activation)
Output:       14 probabilities (softmax)
```

**Input Features**:
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| team1_score | Your team's current score |
| team2_score | Opponent's current score |
| team1_bags | Your team's bag count |
| team2_bags | Opponent's bag count |
| bid_0..bid_3 | Previous bids (-1 if not yet made) |

**Training Objective**: Cross-entropy loss against the bid that led to winning games.

### NN2: Playing Policy Network

**Purpose**: Predict which card to play from the current hand.

**Architecture**:
```
Input Layer:  326 features
Hidden:       384 → 384 → 256 (ReLU activation)
Output:       52 probabilities (one per possible card)
```

**Input Features (326 total)**:

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Game state | 4 | Scores and bags |
| Bids | 4 | Each player's bid |
| Hand encoding | 52 | One-hot: which cards you hold |
| Current trick | 52 | One-hot: cards played this trick |
| Tricks won | 4 | Count per player |
| Spades broken | 1 | Boolean flag |
| Current player | 1 | Player index (0-3) |
| **Card memory** | **208** | **Which cards each player has played** |

The **card memory** (4 players × 52 cards = 208 features) enables **card counting** - the network learns to track what cards are still in play.

### NN3: Value Network

**Purpose**: Estimate the probability of winning from the current game state.

**Architecture**:
```
Input Layer:  4 features
Hidden:       4 (Softplus activation)
Output:       1 (Sigmoid → probability)
```

**Input Features**:
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| total_points | Sum of both team's scores |
| point_differential | Your score - opponent's score |
| team_bags | Your bag count |
| other_bags | Opponent's bag count |

**Input Normalization**: Features are scaled by [1000, 100, 10, 10] respectively.

**Training Objective**: Binary cross-entropy against actual game outcomes.

## 4. Self-Play Reinforcement Learning

### The Training Loop

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Self-Play Training Loop                     │
│                                                                 │
│  ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌────────┐ │
│  │ Self-Play│ --> │ Collect  │ --> │  Train   │ --> │Evaluate│ │
│  │  Games   │     │  Data    │     │ Networks │     │vs Base │ │
│  └──────────┘     └──────────┘     └──────────┘     └────────┘ │
│       ↑                                                  │      │
│       └──────────── If win_rate ≥ 55%, promote ─────────┘      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Self-Play**: The current best model plays games against itself
2. **Data Collection**: Record (state, action, outcome) tuples
3. **Training**: Update neural networks via supervised learning
4. **Evaluation**: Compare candidate model vs baseline
5. **Promotion**: If candidate wins ≥55% of games, it becomes the new baseline

### Why Self-Play Works

Self-play creates a **curriculum**: as the bot improves, it faces stronger opponents (itself), continuously pushing the difficulty level. This avoids:
- The need for human expert data
- Getting stuck exploiting weak opponent patterns
- Manual difficulty tuning

---

## 5. ELO Rating System

We measure bot strength using the **ELO rating system** (from chess):

$$
E_A = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{(R_B - R_A)/400}}
$$

Where:
- $E_A$ = Expected win probability for player A
- $R_A, R_B$ = Ratings of players A and B

After a game, ratings update:

$$
R'_A = R_A + K(S_A - E_A)
$$

Where:
- $K$ = Update factor (typically 32)
- $S_A$ = Actual score (1 for win, 0 for loss, 0.5 for draw)

### Observed Training Progression

| Training Time | Approximate ELO | Skill Level |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 0 min (start) | 1000 | Random play |
| 30 min | 1400-1600 | Beats random consistently |
| 60 min | 1700-1900 | Strategic bidding |
| 90 min | 1800-2100 | Card counting, team play |
| Ceiling | ~2200-2500 | Near-optimal with 150 sims |

## 6. The Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff

A central theme in this AI is balancing:

- **Exploration**: Try new moves to discover better strategies
- **Exploitation**: Use known good moves to maximize wins

This tradeoff appears at multiple levels:

| Level | Exploration | Exploitation |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| MCTS Search | UCB1 exploration term | UCB1 mean value term |
| Training | New candidate models | Keep proven baseline |
| Bidding | Try risky nil bids | Stick to safe bids |
| Playing | Trump with spades | Follow suit conservatively |

---

## 7. Computational Complexity

### Per-Move Analysis

| Component | Operations | Browser Feasibility |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| MCTS (30 sims) | ~30 × (game simulation) | ✓ Fast |
| MCTS (150 sims) | ~150 × (game simulation) | ✓ Acceptable |
| NN1 inference | ~8K multiply-adds | ✓ Instant |
| NN2 inference | ~300K multiply-adds | ✓ Fast |
| NN3 inference | ~32 multiply-adds | ✓ Instant |

### State Space Analysis

- **Cards in deck**: 52
- **Players**: 4
- **Cards per hand**: 13
- **Possible deals**: $\binom{52}{13} \times \binom{39}{13} \times \binom{26}{13} \approx 5 \times 10^{28}$
- **Game tree depth**: 13 tricks × 4 plays = 52 plies

This enormous state space is why we need MCTS rather than exhaustive search.

## 8. Key Mathematical Insights

### Why MCTS + Neural Networks Works

1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Neural networks compress the 326-dimensional state into meaningful policy/value estimates
2. **Generalization**: Networks learn patterns that transfer across similar positions
3. **Anytime Property**: MCTS can be stopped at any time and return the current best move
4. **Self-Correction**: Backpropagation fixes initially wrong value estimates

### The Power of Card Memory

Adding the 208 card-tracking features improved win rate by ~15%:

- **Before**: Bot couldn't remember what cards were played
- **After**: Bot can deduce what cards opponents might hold
- **Example**: If all clubs except the Ace are played, the bot knows someone has the Ace

---

## 9. Limitations and Future Directions

### Current Limitations

- **No bluffing model**: Can't represent opponent psychology
- **Imperfect information**: Doesn't explicitly model opponent hands
- **Fixed partners**: Assumes cooperative play with partner

### Potential Improvements

1. **Information Set MCTS**: Model uncertainty about opponent hands
2. **Opponent Modeling**: Predict opponent tendencies
3. **Deeper Networks**: More capacity for complex patterns
4. **Attention Mechanisms**: Focus on relevant cards/players
